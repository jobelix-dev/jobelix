These keywords will be used to optimize a resume for ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility.\n\n## Rules\n- Extract ACTUAL keywords from the job description - do not invent terms\n- Include both explicit terms (directly stated) and implicit terms (strongly implied)\n- Keep all terms, including generic ones (\"team player\", \"fast learner\") - ATS systems often scan for these\n- Deduplicate similar terms (keep the most specific version)\n- Limit to 20-30 keywords total across all categories\n\n## Categories\n1. **technical_skills**: Programming languages, frameworks, tools, platforms (e.g., \"Python\", \"React\", \"AWS\", \"Docker\")\n2. **soft_skills**: Interpersonal and professional skills (e.g., \"leadership\", \"communication\", \"problem-solving\")\n3. **domain_terms**: Industry-specific terminology and concepts (e.g., \"machine learning\", \"microservices\", \"agile\", \"CI/CD\")\n4. **action_verbs**: Key verbs describing responsibilities (e.g., \"architected\", \"implemented\", \"optimized\", \"led\")\n\n## Output Format\nReturn ONLY a valid JSON object with this exact structure (no markdown, no explanations):\n\n{\n  \"technical_skills\": [\"Python\", \"React\", \"AWS\", \"PostgreSQL\"],\n  \"soft_skills\": [\"leadership\", \"communication\", \"collaboration\"],\n  \"domain_terms\": [\"microservices\", \"CI/CD\", \"agile\", \"DevOps\"],\n  \"action_verbs\": [\"architected\", \"implemented\", \"optimized\", \"led\"]\n}\n\n---\n\n## Job Description:\n{job_description}\n\n---\n\n## Instructions:\nExtract keywords from the job description above.
